Future In Dart
In dart, the Future represents a value or error that is not yet available. It is used to represent a potential value, or error, that will be available at some time in the future. 

How To Create Future In Dart :

You can create a future in dart by using Future class. Here the function will return Future<String> after 5 seconds.

// function that returns a future
Future<String> getUserName() async {
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Mark');
}

You can also create a future by using Future.value() method. Here the function will return Future<String> immediately.

// function that returns a future
Future<String> getUserName() {
  return Future.value('Mark');
}

How To Use Future In Dart :

You can use future in dart by using then() method. Here the function will return Future<String> after 5 seconds.

*/

// function that returns a future
Future<String> getUserName() async {
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () => 'Mark');
}

// main function
void main() {
  print("Start");
  getUserName().then((value) => print(value));
  print("End");
}

/*
More About Future
Future represents the result of an asynchronous operation and can have 2 states.

State Of Future:
Uncompleted
Completed

Uncompleted:
When you call an asynchronous function, it returns to an uncompleted future. It means the future is waiting for the function asynchronous operation to finish or to throw an error.

Completed:
It can be completed with value or completed with error. Future<int> produces an int value, and Future<String> produces a String value. If the future doesnâ€™t produce any value, then the type of future is Future<void>.
